## Project Goals
- Implement a modern UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Create a professional healthcare-themed design
- Ensure full responsiveness across all device sizes
- Improve accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- Enhance user experience with better navigation and feedback
- Maintain existing functionality during migration

## Current State
The existing frontend is a basic React application with:
- Vanilla CSS styling
- Limited responsive design
- Basic authentication flow
- Two prediction interfaces (tabular data and ECG analysis)
- No component library or design system

## Target Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React.js (maintaining current version)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.x
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Context API

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Set up shadcn/ui component library
- ✅ Create design system with consistent colors, typography, and spacing

### Phase 2: Core Components Development (PENDING)
- [ ] Create responsive navigation with mobile menu
- [ ] Redesign authentication forms (login/registration) with improved UX
- [ ] Create dashboard layout for authenticated users
- [ ] Implement core UI components

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement (PENDING)
- [ ] Redesign landing page with modern UI elements
- [ ] Enhance tabular data prediction interface with better form layout
- [ ] Improve ECG analysis interface with file upload enhancements
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (PENDING)
- [ ] Implement accessible components following WCAG guidelines
- [ ] Add animations and transitions for smooth user experience
- [ ] Optimize for fast loading times
- [ ] Test responsiveness across different device sizes
- [ ] Update documentation with new component structure

## Design System

### Color Palette
- Primary: Medical blue (#0EA5E9) for trust and professionalism
- Secondary: Teal (#0D9488) for health-related elements
- Neutral: Gray scale for backgrounds and text
- Semantic colors for status indicators

### Typography
- Primary font: Inter (clean and modern)
- Consistent hierarchy with proper contrast ratios
- Responsive font sizing

### Spacing
- 4px grid system for consistent spacing
- Responsive spacing for different viewports

## Component Specifications

### UI Components
- Button (variants: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
- Card (with header, content, footer)
- Input (with validation states)
- Select (single and multi-select)
- Dialog (modal with backdrop)
- Toast (notification system)

### Layout Components
- Header (with logo, navigation, user menu)
- Sidebar (collapsible with responsive behavior)
- Dashboard Layout (grid-based content organization)

### Feature Components
- Authentication forms with improved UX
- Tabular data prediction interface
- ECG analysis workflow with file upload
- Result display with visualizations
- Loading states and skeleton screens

## Migration Strategy

### Approach
- Parallel development alongside existing code
- Gradual component replacement
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Feature flagging for gradual rollout

### Risk Mitigation
- Thorough testing in isolated environment
- Regular progress reviews and milestone checks
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Version control and rollback procedures

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- First contentful paint < 1.5 seconds
- Bundle size < 200KB gzipped
- Lighthouse scores > 90

### User Experience
- Task completion rate > 95%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Error rate < 1%
- Accessibility score > 95%
