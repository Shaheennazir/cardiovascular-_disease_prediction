# Model Loading Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the model loading issues in the cardiovascular disease prediction backend.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Tabular Model Loading Failure (`invalid load key, '\x02'`)

**Problem**: The tabular model was failing to load with a pickle deserialization error.

**Root Causes**:
- File corruption during save/transfer
- Python version mismatch between training and deployment
- Pickle protocol incompatibility
- Wrong file being loaded (not a pickle file)

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Updated `backend/app/services/tabular_service.py`**:
   - Added `joblib` import for better sklearn model compatibility
   - Implemented dual loading strategy (joblib → pickle fallback)
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
   - Added proper exception handling around model loading

2. **Created `backend/regenerate_models.py`**:
   - Script to recreate model files with proper serialization
   - Uses joblib with compression for better compatibility
   - Includes verification of saved files
   - Can be used to generate fresh model files for testing

### 2. CUDA/GPU Warnings

**Problem**: TensorFlow was looking for CUDA/GPU but not finding it, causing warnings.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Updated `backend/main.py`**:
   - Added environment variables at the top of the file:
     ```python
     os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '-1'  # Force CPU only
     os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'   # Reduce TF logging
     ```
   - This prevents TensorFlow from trying to initialize GPU support

### 3. Model Compilation Warning

**Problem**: ECG model was loaded but not properly compiled, causing warnings about metrics.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Updated `backend/app/services/ecg_service.py`**:
   - Added explicit model compilation after loading:
     ```python
     self.model.compile(
         optimizer='adam',
         loss='binary_crossentropy',
         metrics=['accuracy']
     )
     ```

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/services/tabular_service.py` - Enhanced model loading with joblib support
2. `backend/app/services/ecg_service.py` - Added model compilation after loading
3. `backend/main.py` - Added CUDA environment variables
4. `backend/README.md` - Updated documentation with model regeneration instructions

## New Files Created

1. `backend/regenerate_models.py` - Script to recreate model files properly
2. `backend/diagnose_models.py` - Diagnostic script to check model file integrity
3. `backend/diagnostic_requirements.txt` - Minimal requirements for diagnostics
4. `backend/install_deps.sh` - Installation script for dependencies
5. `backend/MODEL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Usage Instructions

### To Regenerate Model Files:
```bash
cd backend
python regenerate_models.py
```

### To Diagnose Model Issues:
```bash
cd backend
# Install minimal dependencies
pip install -r diagnostic_requirements.txt
python diagnose_models.py
```

### To Install Dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x install_deps.sh
./install_deps.sh
```

## Verification

The fixes address all three critical issues mentioned in the task:

✅ **Tabular Model Loading**: Now uses joblib with pickle fallback and better error handling
✅ **CUDA/GPU Warnings**: Suppressed by setting environment variables to force CPU-only mode
✅ **Model Compilation Warning**: Resolved by explicitly compiling the ECG model after loading

These changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving robustness and error handling.
