# Migration Plan: From Current Implementation to Modern Frontend

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step approach to migrate the existing Cardiovascular Disease Prediction frontend to a modern implementation using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. The migration will be performed incrementally to minimize disruption and maintain functionality throughout the process.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Structure
- Basic React application (v19.2.0)
- Vanilla CSS styling with minimal component structure
- Authentication flow (login/registration)
- Two prediction interfaces (tabular data and ECG analysis)
- API service layer for backend communication

### Technical Debt
- No design system or consistent styling
- Limited responsive design
- Basic accessibility implementation
- No component library for UI consistency
- Manual CSS management without utility-first approach

## Migration Strategy

### Approach
We'll use a parallel development approach where we:
1. Set up the new tooling alongside existing code
2. Create new components in isolation
3. Gradually replace existing components
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition
5. Remove old code once fully migrated

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Dependency conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing in isolated environment
   - Contingency: Rollback to previous version if critical issues

2. **Performance degradation**
   - Mitigation: Monitor bundle size and Lighthouse scores
   - Contingency: Optimize or remove non-critical features

3. **Browser compatibility issues**
   - Mitigation: Regular cross-browser testing
   - Contingency: Polyfills or fallback implementations

### Operational Risks
1. **Extended development time**
   - Mitigation: Regular progress reviews and milestone checks
   - Contingency: Prioritize core features, defer enhancements

2. **Loss of existing functionality**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing suite
   - Contingency: Version control and rollback procedures

3. **Team knowledge gaps**
   - Mitigation: Pair programming and knowledge sharing
   - Contingency: External consultation or training

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
1. Unit tests for components
2. Integration tests for data flows
3. Snapshot tests for UI consistency
4. Accessibility tests (axe-core)

### Manual Testing
1. Cross-browser compatibility
2. Device responsiveness
3. User acceptance testing
4. Performance benchmarking

### Quality Gates
1. Code review for each component
2. Accessibility audit before merge
3. Performance budget adherence
